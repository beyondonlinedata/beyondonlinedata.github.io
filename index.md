title: "Beyond Online Data: Tackling Challenging Social Science Questions"
---

## Summary
The abundance of online data has provided exciting opportunities for computational social science. However, most social processes thrive at the intersections of online and offline worlds. It thus becomes necessary to connect online studies to the offline world, especially for tackling broad social science questions such as information access, education, healthcare, migration, discrimination, and poverty. This ICWSM workshop on “Beyond online data” aims to bring together social scientists and computer scientists to think about new ways to utilize data for addressing challenging social science questions. 

This includes novel ways of utilizing offline data, combining offline and online data, and creating new data through observation and experiments. Instead of starting with available datasets, the workshop will discuss approaches that start with a substantive question and find possible ways to leverage diverse potential datasets, including both online data and offline data.

## Call for papers
We invite submissions relevant to the theme of the workshop, including, but not limited to: 
- Studies on substantive questions that go beyond the online world 
- Observational studies that leverage offline data 
- Experiments that include offline data 
- Methodologies for combining insights from diverse datasets
- Benchmarking online studies through offline data 
- Generalizability of online studies to the offline world

Examples of offline data that may be combined with online data include but are not limited to: 
- Human mobility/ Migration 
- Neighborhood characteristics data 
- Health records 
- Census data 
- Educational data 
- Poverty/unemployment data 
- International trade 
- Financial data 
- Consumer indices 
- Consumer behavior data 
- Elections data 

## Important Dates 
- Paper due date: Apr 22, 2018
- Author notification date: May 15, 2018
- Camera ready due: June 1, 2018
- Workshop date: June 25, 2018  

## Submission Guidelines 
### Format
We encourage submissions of work-in-progress, extended abstracts, unpublished results, and accepted papers at top conferences/journals. All authors are required to use the AAAI Author Kit to format their papers. The author kit is available at <http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit18.zip>. Submissions should be 2-8 pages. Accepted papers will be presented in the format of either posters or talks.

### Submission Link
Papers should be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bod18).

### Participation 
This workshop features group activity in addition to invited talks and paper/poster presentations. We encourage interested participants to send us a paragraph by June 1, 2018 to indicate their expertise and research interests, such as “qualitative”, “quantitative”, “education”, and “information diffusion”, and questions for a fishbowl-style discussion.  All questions about submissions should be emailed to [beyondonlinedata18@gmail.com](mailto:beyondonlinedata18@gmail.com).
